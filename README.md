# Exploratory Data Analysis of CitiBike System Data in New Jersey and Hoboken: Insights and Trends from the NYC Citi Bike Data [2021 - 2023] .
Since its launch in 2013, New York City's Citibike system has been a well-liked means of transportation for
commuters and visitors alike. Since then, the system has been extended to more regions, including Hoboken and
New Jersey, giving its consumers even more convenience. This project report focuses on investigating the Citibike
system statistics for the years 2021 to 2023 in the cities of New Jersey and Hoboken that were taken from the bigger
NYC dataset.

The purpose of the research questions covered in this study is to shed light on the utilization trends and patterns of
the Citi Bike system in Hoboken and New Jersey. Initially, we look into the weekly and seasonal patterns of Citi
Bike usage in the focus areas. Second, we investigate any demographic factors—such as age and gender—that might
have an impact on these usage patterns. Finally, we look into whether member riders and casual riders have any
different usage habits. To gain useful insights from the information, a number of data visualization and statistical
methodologies were employed. According to the statistics, there are significant seasonal and weekly consumption
patterns seen in the Hoboken and New Jersey regions, with usage obviously rising throughout the summer and on
weekends. Males and younger age groups tend to utilize the Citibike system more frequently than females and older
age groups, and there were also other noticeable demographic disparities in utilization patterns. Our data also
showed that compared to casual riders, members use the Citi Bike system more frequently and for longer periods of
time. For stakeholders and decision-makers in the transportation sector, the findings from this project report may be
valuable in making wise choices regarding the operations and regulations of the Citi Bike system. This project report
offers insightful information about the usage trends and patterns of the Citi Bike system in the Hoboken and New
Jersey regions. The results point to significant seasonal and weekly usage patterns, demographic usage pattern
disparities, and different usage patterns between casual and member riders. In order to improve the Citibike system's
operations and the services it offers to its consumers, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions by having a
greater understanding of these trends and patterns.
